## Routes documentation

The following documents describe the possible routes of the application. The software is designed as a SPA (Single Page Application), which means that the routes do not correspond to different `.html` documents but to dynamic objects, generated by the front-end router [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/). Nevertheless, the routes are directly accessable through the URL browser bar and will load their contents, if the corresponding access requirements are fully met.

### `/login`

> A view for logging in the application
